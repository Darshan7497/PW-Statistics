It is calculated as the average of the product of the deviations of two variables from their respective means. Covariance can take on any value between negative infinity and positive infinity, and is measured in the units of the two variables.

A negative covariance indicates a negative relationship, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.\n",

It is calculated by dividing the covariance of two variables by the product of their standard deviations.

Correlation is unitless, meaning that it does not depend on the units of the variables.\n",

Covariance is used in some calculations, such as the calculation of regression coefficients, while correlation is more commonly used because it is easier to interpret and compare. Correlation is used to identify relationships between variables, to test hypotheses about the strength of those relationships, and to make predictions about one variable based on the value of another.
